The aim is to use Caffe Colorization model to convert b&w images to a colored one. 

Steps - 

1. Load the model and the convolutional/kernel points
2. Preprocess the image
3. Generate model predictions using the L channel for the input image
4. Use the ab channel to create the resulting img. 

Now L and the ab channel are part of Lab color space. 
 - Similarly to RGB, this also has three channels. 
 - The differentiating point is that in RBG we take into consideration the pixel values, but in this all
 three of them have different significances. 
 - L is the lightness channel, which is the same as the intensity of the pixel.
 - a is the red-green axis, and b is the blue-yellow axis.
 - The values of a and b are between -128 and 128.
 - The values of L are between 0 and 100.


 In other words, we'll use the L channel of the img as input to the model and predict the ab channel
 values and rejoin it with the L channel values to produce the final colored img.
